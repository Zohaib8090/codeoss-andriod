# Project State — CodeOSS Android

## Current Milestone

Milestone 1: Core Native

## Current Progress
*   **Active Phase**: Phase 04 - Native Editor Polish & LSP Integration
*   **Status**: In Progress
*   **Recent Accomplishments**: 
    *   Completed Phase 06 (Marketplace & Extension Management) out-of-order.
    *   Built `LspClient` (JSON-RPC 2.0 streaming engine over standard I/O).
    *   Bridged `TerminalViewModel` to background Node.js language servers.
    *   Implemented `CodeEditor.kt` UI for real-time Diagnostics (error panels and badges) and Autocomplete dropdowns.
*   **Next Steps**: 
    *   Implement actual text-insertion logic for Autocomplete (`textDocument/completion` resolution).
    *   Add red wavy underlines directly beneath the text via `SyntaxVisualTransformation`.

## Status Summary

Phase 06 (Marketplace & Extension Management) is **complete**. Key accomplishments:
- **Dynamic Marketplace**: Successfully connected the native app to the `Zohaib8090/codeoss-andriod` repository to fetch plugins.
- **Progress Tracking**: Implemented real-time progress bars for NPM and ZIP installations directly on the UI thread.
- **Project Awareness**: App correctly checks the active project's `node_modules` to determine if a package (like the Web LSP) is installed.
- **Robust Sideloading**: Added manual ZIP installation support and fixed absolute paths for robust NPM execution via `ProcessBuilder`.

## Next Steps

1. **LSP Integration (Phase 4)**: Set up the JSON-RPC bridge between the native editor and the newly installed Node.js language servers (like the Web LSP).
2. **Syntax Highlighting**: Implement a high-performance grammar parser using Kotlin and Skia.
3. **Tabbed Editing**: Allow opening multiple files in a tabbed interface.

## Blockers

- **None** — The Marketplace and plugin ecosystem are fully operational.
