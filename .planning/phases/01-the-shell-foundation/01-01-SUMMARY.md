# Plan 01-01 Summary: Native PTY Bridge

## Objective
Implemented the native PTY bridge using NDK and JNI.

## Changes Made
- Created `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` to manage the native build.
- Updated `app/build.gradle.kts` to link CMake to the Android build process.
- Implemented `app/src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp` with `forkpty` support and JNI entry points.

## Key Files Created/Modified
- [CMakeLists.txt](file:///c:/Users/zohai/Downloads/my code/codeoss-android/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt) [NEW]
- [native-lib.cpp](file:///c:/Users/zohai/Downloads/my code/codeoss-android/app/src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp) [NEW]
- [build.gradle.kts](file:///c:/Users/zohai/Downloads/my code/codeoss-android/app/build.gradle.kts) [MODIFY]

## Self-Check
- [x] NDK build configured
- [x] JNI `createPty` implemented
- [x] JNI `setWindowSize` implemented

## Next Steps
Proceed to Wave 2 to integrate this bridge with the Kotlin/Compose layer.
